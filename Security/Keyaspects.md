* No sensitive information is exposed
* Accurate timestamping of data


## Hardware
* Never using devices with default passwords.
* Keep updating the firmware for the latest patch

### PKI Signature Adoption
Ideal for:
* Embedded devices
* Resource constrained devices
* Microcontroller based devices with flash/firmware
* Any IoT device that needs to make their own KeyScaler calls for security operations
