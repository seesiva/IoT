# Addressing Privacy
IoT systems integrate in a seamless way physical objects, data, and computing devices into a global network of information about “smart things”. Privacy-Friendly system should support the following:
* System should allow to decide what to share and what not-to-share
* System should outline for which purpose the information collected will be used
* The subject must be able to fully control the mechanism used to ensure
their privacy
* The subject shall be informed whenever information is used and by
whom;
* During interactions between a subject and an IoT system, only strictly
needed information shall be disclosed about the subject, and
pseudonyms, secondary identity, or assertions (certified properties of the end-user) shall be used whenever possible;
* It shall not be possible to infer the subject’s identity by
aggregating/reasoning over information available at various sources;
* Information gained for a specific purpose shall not be used for another
purpose. E.g., the bank issuing a credit card should not use a given
client’s purchase information (logged so to keep track of that client’s
account) to send him advertising on goods similar to his purchaces.
