## CIA Definitions
Definitions of the levels of integrity, availability and confidentiality are as follows:
* **Integrity**
    - Basic - devices resist low level threat sources that have very little capability and priority
    - Medium - devices resist medium level threat sources that have from very little, focussed capability, through to researchers with significant capability
    - High - devices resist substantial level threat sources
* **Availability**
    - Basic - devices whose lack of availability would cause minor disruption
    - Medium – devices whose lack of availability would have limited impact on an individual or organisation
    - High – devices whose lack of availability would have significant impact to an individual or organisation, or impacts many individuals
* **Confidentiality**
    - Basic – devices processing public information
    - Medium – devices processing sensitive information, including Personally Identifiable Information, whose compromise would have limited impact on an individual or organisation
    - High - devices processing very sensitive information, including sensitive personal data whose compromise would have significant impact on an individual or organisation.
