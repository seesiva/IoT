3. What kind of Business Models are under evaluation ? (Example: SaaS based revenue models)
4. Do we need to establish a seperate portal for the IoT/Connected product lines ?
5. Do we have plan for developing an MVP (Minimum Viable product ) ?
6. If yes, is it possible to get some insight on the MVP Planned ?
7. Do we have a requirement to deactivate sensors if the product is operating on a battery ?
8. Do we have a clarity on what data to be sent from the product ? (Examples ?)
9. What are the key parameters to be managed from the device stand point (E.g., State, Interval)
10. Proximity of the products being together ?
