# NB-IoT
NarrowBand Internet of Things
* Open Standard
* LTE and 3GPP Support from many vendors
* Familiar to network engineers,application developers and hardware developers with Cellular technologies
* Security inherited from cellular technology
* References: Vodafont NB-IoT Whitepaper

## Use case scenarios
* Long lifespan in the field - Examples: Agriculture (Soil Monitor)
* Deep Coverage - Examples : Large Plants with condition monitoring capabilities for Water, Gas, etc., 
* Massive Scale - Examples: Large volume of field devices (higher device density - Parking Sensors, Garbage bins, Highly populated Lights, etc.,)
* Low Bandwidth - Examples: Data on demand to be sent only at limited intervals

## Features
### Coverage
*  NB-IoT offers coverage penetration in difficult environments that characterise LPWA use cases, since it uses licensed spectrum bands (just like 3G and 4G) NB-IoT isn’t significantly affected by interference.

### Throughput
* Faster data throughput, without limitations on usage.
* NB-IoT isn’t limited by legal restrictions on how often each device can transmit — so-called “duty cycle”.
* Provide performance benefits, which is vital when planning ahead a decade or more.

### Power Management
* Flexible power management for 15-year operational lifespans. 
* Despite its coverage and performance advantages, NB-IoT offers comparable battery life toother LPWA technologies, thanks in part to advanced power-saving modes that minimise unnecessary chatter over the network.

### Design minimization
* Simple designs for cost-effectiveness. 
* NB-IoT has been designed to minimise hardware costs, from chipset fabrication to antennas
* Forecast exits that communications component costs will drop to $2 once full production is reached.
