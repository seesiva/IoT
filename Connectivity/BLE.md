## What is Bluetooth Mesh?
* Formally launched in July 2017
* Blueooth Mesh capability enables many-to-many (m:m) device communications and is optimized for creating large-scale device networks.
* Bluetooth Mesh is networking technology
* Bluetooth Mesh -----------Uses---------> Bluetooth LE

### Essential characteristics of Bluetooth Mesh
* Coverage of very large areas
* "Just works interoperability"
* The ability to monitor and control large numbers of devices
* Optimized, low energy consumption
* Efficient use of radio resources, leading to scalability
* Compatibility with currently available smartphone, tablet and personal computer products
* Industry-standard, government-grade security

### Key terms and concepts on Bluetooth Mesh
* Bluetooth uses 'Pub/Sub Messaging' pattern
* Devices in a Bluetooth mesh network each have a set of independent 'State' values, representing some condition of the device.
* Model defines the specification on Device State, State Transitions, Messages and other associated behaviours.
