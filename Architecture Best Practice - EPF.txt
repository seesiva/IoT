# Architecture Reference Points
http://epf.eclipse.org/wikis/epfpractices/

# Architecture Goals
* What is the expected lifespan of the system?
* Will the system need to respond to technological changes over that time, such as new versions of middleware or other products?
* How frequently is the system expected to adapt to change?
* What changes can we anticipate in the future, and how can we make them easier to accommodate?

# Architecture Constraints
* Network topology
* Use of a given database vendor or an existing database
* Web environment (server configurations, firewall, DMZs, and so forth)
* Servers (hardware model, operating system)
* Use of third-party software or a particular technology
* Compliance with existing standards

# Architecturally significant requirements
Architecturally significant requirements are a subset of the requirements that need to be satisfied before the architecture can be considered "stable". Typically, these are requirements that are technically challenging, technically constraining, or central to the system's purpose. Furthermore, the system will generally be more sensitive to changes against architecturally significant requirements, so identifying and communicating this subset will help others understand the potential implications of change.
