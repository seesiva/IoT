# Platform Evaluation Criteria

## Challanges/Concerns/Confusion
* Whether to build new or use an existing pre-built platform as an OEM ?
* Do the apps and functions allow me to fill gaps within my own platform without throwing away what has already been developed?
* Can they be customized or personalized to support my unique needs and do I have the flexibility to mix and match depending on my  customer or partner’s needs?
* Is it built on an open platform or is the system proprietary?
* Is the platform one that is scalable enough to support web-scale or enterprise deployments?
* How easily can it be integrated with my software?
* Can I use my cloud service provider of choice?
* Is the platform one that is created by an OEM? Let’s face it, OEMs are the best at understanding OEM challenges. It boils down to one simple thing – do you want to partner with someone who might view your connectivity needs as their experiment versus someone that has already experienced and solved the same issues you need to solve?
* Does this platform require that you only use their equipment? Or can it be used on equipment you are already using or prefer?
* Is the platform cloud service provider agnostic?
* Does the platform support a multi-tenancy environment and can it be adapted for enterprise deployments involving multiple stakeholders?
* How long has the platform provider been around and do they have any other business to sustain a long-term software investment?
* How much are you going to have to invest to adapt your own software to operate with this platform? Or will you be required to rip and replace your existing software?
